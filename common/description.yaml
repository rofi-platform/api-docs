  # Authentication

  ### Acquiring an API Key
  All HTTP requests made against the ROFI API must be validated with a pair of API Key (app_id and access_key). If you don't have an API Key Pair yet contact the [Project Manager](mailto:user@example.com) to register for one.

  ### Using Your API Key
  You may use any *server side* programming language that can make HTTP requests to target the ROFI API. All requests should target domain `https://api-dev.rofi.games`.

  You can supply your API Key Pair in REST API calls via two custom header named `app_id` and `access_key`

  # Errors and Rate Limits
  ### HTTP Status Codes
  The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call.

  - `400 (Bad Request)` The server could not process the request, likely due to an invalid argument.
  - `401 (Unauthorized)` Your request lacks valid authentication credentials, likely an issue with your API Key.
  - `404 (Not Found)` The resource could not be found.
  - `429 (Too Many Requests)` The transaction creation for an user rate limit was exceeded; consider slowing down your API Request frequency for this user if this is an HTTP request throttling error.
  - `500 (Internal Server Error)` An unexpected server issue was encountered.
  
  ### Error Response Codes
  A `code` field is always included in the JSON response payload for both successful calls and failures when possible. During error scenarios you may reference the `code` and `message` properties of the response object. One of the API error codes below will be returned if applicable otherwise the HTTP status code for the general error type is returned.
