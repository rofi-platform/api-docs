  # Errors and Rate Limits
  ### HTTP Status Codes
  The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call.

  - `400 (Bad Request)` The server could not process the request, likely due to an invalid argument.
  - `401 (Unauthorized)` Your request lacks valid authentication credentials, likely an issue with your API Key.
  - `401 (Unauthorized)` The resource can not be found.
  - `429 (Too Many Requests)` The transaction creation for an user rate limit was exceeded; consider slowing down your API Request frequency for this user if this is an HTTP request throttling error.
  - `500 (Internal Server Error)` An unexpected server issue was encountered.
  
  ### Error Response Codes
  A `code` field is always included in the JSON response payload for both successful calls and failures when possible. During error scenarios you may reference the `code` and `message` properties of the response object. One of the API error codes below will be returned if applicable otherwise the HTTP status code for the general error type is returned.
